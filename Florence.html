<div id="panel">
    <p>During my summer in Florence, I took part in a six week Miami program where I took two classes: European Film and Storytelling through Food.I lived in a little apartment on via del Giglio with 5 other girls from Miami, who have become great friends of mine.</p>
    
    <p>Summers in Florence are hot and crowded, however, it felt like home after a short six weeks. Walking is the main way of transportation, and manuvering around tourists becomes a quickly developed skill. Spots like the Duomo, Piazza del Santo Spirito, Pino's and the countless open air markets were some of my favorite places to visit in Florence. The river running straight down the center splits Florence in half and was a lovely place to jog in the mornings before it got hot.</p>

    <p>The outskirts of Florence is famous for the hundrends of winerys and tuscan regions. Just a short bus ride takes you to beautiful vineyards and unbelievable views. However, within Florence sits art museaums containg world masterpieces such as Michelangelo's The David, Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus," and much more. </p>
    
    <p>Spending my summer in this amazing city was an experience that I will never forget, and I hope to spend more time here in the future.</p>
